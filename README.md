# Who am i?

- Hi, i’m [Jefferson Bueno](https://www.github.com/jeffbuenx), a Computer Science student at the Institute Of Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of São Paulo ([ICMC-USP](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/about)).

- I'm aiming to create high performance applications, making them as optimized as i can, and i'm also a lot into data security. Because of that, my mainly focus is middle/low-level programming languages.
- However, i still frequently use high-level languages like python, and and i plan to dive deeply into artificial inteligence.
- I'm obssessed with Unix ricing and customization. If i will stay most of my time somewhere, that place should be efficient, confortable, and beautiful, right?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c, c++, java, python, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on anything that interest me!
- 📫 How to reach me: @jeffbuenx on telegram
