## What i do?

- I'm aiming to create high performance applications, making them as optimized as i can, and i'm also a lot into data security. Because of that, my mainly focus is middle/low-level programming languages.

- However, i still frequently use high-level languages like python, and and i plan to dive deeply into artificial inteligence.

- I'm obssessed with Unix ricing and customization. If i'm going to spend most of my time somewhere, that place should be efficient, confortable, and beautiful, right?

## What am i learning?
I'm currently learning: 
- **C**: Because there is always more to know!
- **C++, Java, Python, Lua**:
- **JS and CSS**: I'm not an assiduous web-dev, but it's always useful
- **Assembly**: Learning this is pure pain, but it's powerful

## What am i willing to collaborate on?
I'm willing to collaborate with open-source projects.
